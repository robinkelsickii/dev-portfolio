        <p class="mb-4">
          I am a huge nerd: Anime, video games, cosplaying, comic conventions, and computers are my
          loves. 10 years ago, if you told me I'd have anything to do with programming, I wouldn't
          have believed it. I never thought about that; I was supposed to be a Top Gun Ace Navy
          pilot. With both parents in the military, I thought that was where I was headed, and I
          did.

        <p class="mb-4">
          In high school, my performance was mediocre. I marched in the marching band and played
          varsity soccer in my sophomore year. I was so focused on things that maybe I lost sight of
          what was important. But everything changed when I discovered programming.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Now, I am a full-stack developer with a passion for creating web applications and learning
          new technologies. I love solving problems and building projects that make a difference.
