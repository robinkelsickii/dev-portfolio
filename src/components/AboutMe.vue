        <p class="mb-4">
          I am a huge nerd: Anime, video games, cosplaying, comic conventions, and computers are my
          loves. 10 years ago, if you told me I'd have anything to do with programming, I wouldn't
          have believed it. I never thought about that; I was supposed to be a Top Gun Ace Navy
          pilot. With both parents in the military, I thought that was where I was headed, and I
          did.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In high school, my performance was mediocre. I marched in the marching band and played
          varsity soccer in my sophomore year. I was so focused on things that maybe I lost sight of
          who I wanted to be. I ended up enlisting in the Marine Corps, and somewhere down the line,
          I started college.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Through college, I learned a lot about myself, more than just outside the classroom. I
          learned that I loved games, not for what they were, but for what they were on the inside.
          I started thinking about how mechanics worked and how any developer would have come up
          with a way to do those things. That curiosity started spreading to everything: mechanical
          objects, puzzles, cups. These things made me realize that I was analytical and curious.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I was a psychology major at the time, but I was more interested in computer science. Due
          to financial concerns, I couldn't finish school, so I went for a programming bootcamp.
          There, I learned the foundation of the skills that I know today, and the rest is history.
        </p>

          I created this site to show my passion for programming, but also the products and skills I
          gained so that I can work for you and create the things you can only dream of.
