        <p class="mb-4">
          I’m a huge nerd, through and through. Anime, video games, cosplaying, comic conventions,
          and computers are just a few of the things I hold dear. But if you had told me 10 years
          ago that I’d end up programming, I would have laughed. Back then, it wasn’t even on my
          radar. I was certain my future lay in the skies, following in the footsteps of my military
          family as a Top Gun Ace Navy pilot.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Both of my parents served in the military, so it seemed inevitable that I would do the
          same. After graduating high school and feeling unsure about my future, a Marine Corps
          recruiter convinced me to take the leap. Six years later, I could proudly say I had served
          my country. While my path seemed firmly grounded in military service, there was always a
          thread of curiosity pulling me toward technology. My dad, a computer engineer in the Navy
          who still works in the field today, planted the seed of technical interest long before I
          realized it. If curiosity and technical skill are hereditary, I must have inherited them
          straight from him.

          My high school years were a mix of interests and distractions. I played varsity soccer as
          a sophomore and marched in the school band, immersing myself in music and sports. Yet, I
          wasn’t the strongest student academically. Looking back, I realize I spent so much time
          focused on extracurriculars that I lost sight of what might have been truly important at
          the time. But everything changed when I discovered programming.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Today, I am a full-stack developer with a passion for building web applications and
          exploring new technologies. I thrive on solving problems and bringing ideas to life
          through code. Each project I take on feels like an opportunity to make a difference, and
          I’m excited to continue learning, growing, and creating.
